# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-Model

This project is a Multiple Disease Prediction Web Application that uses machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of various diseases based on input data. It is built using Streamlit, Python, and various machine learning models

# Features
Predicts multiple diseases based on user input

User-friendly web interface using Streamlit

Utilizes machine learning algorithms to make accurate predictions

Easy-to-use input forms for user data


# Technologies Used
Python (for backend programming)

Streamlit (for the web interface)

Pandas (for data handling)

Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)

Pickle (for saving and loading models)

Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualizations)

# Usage
Once the app is running, you can:

Input medical data such as symptoms and other relevant details.

Select the diseases you want to predict based on the trained models.

View Your Predicted Disease based on your selection on the web interface

# Data
The dataset used for training the machine learning models is based on publicly available healthcare data, which includes various Symptons of 131 Diseases available in the dataset.The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed before being used for model training.


# Models
This application uses the following machine learning algorithms:

Random Forest Classifier

Uses One-Hot Encoding Technique to process and train the data
